      " The Hult Prize is an international competition that challenges university students to create innovative solutions for global issues. Founded by Ahmad Ashkar and funded by Bertil Hult, it awards $1 million in seed capital to the winning team to launch a social enterprise. Partnered with Hult International Business School and the United Nations Foundation, it&apos;s called the &quot;Nobel Prize for students&quot; by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. At ISTE NITH, we proudly host and conduct the on-campus round of the Hult Prize.",
